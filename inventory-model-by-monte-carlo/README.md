# Inventory modeling using Monte Carlo
in this case we are going to use monte carlo simulation model to predict 

## the main problem should be devided into three smaller problems:

1. [Demand]()
2. [Lead Time]()
3. [inventory]()


## Demand DataFrame
the demand DataFrame is based on older data provided by the user containing number of sold items and it's frequency.

using these data probability can be easly calculated, and also comutative probability is used in this model.

with both of probability and commutative probability the range of random numbers are created to be used later
